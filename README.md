# RuDok

This was a complex MVC architecture project which took us one semester to make.<br>
The project has a very detailed specification in the "RukovalacDokumentimaSpecifikacija" folder.<br>
The specification was created using PowerDesigner.<br>

This is what the application looks like with a created project.

This is a slideshow mode where we can switch between slides, and preview the images and text.

There is a interesting feature which allows us to share presentations between projects.<br>
Each change in any one of the projects that are sharing the same presentation will be reflected in the<br>
other one because they're using the same memory reference.
